Agno supports using MongoDB as a storage backend for Workflows using the `MongoDbWorkflowStorage` class.

## Usage

### Run MongoDB

Install [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) and run **MongoDB** on port **27017** using:

```bash
docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

```python storage.py

import json
from typing import Iterator

import httpx
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.tools.newspaper4k import Newspaper4kTools
from agno.storage.workflow.mongodb import MongoDbWorkflowStorage
from agno.utils.log import logger
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response
from agno.workflow import Workflow
