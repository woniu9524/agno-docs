title: "Agent App: FastAPI, Streamlit and Postgres"
sidebarTitle: Running locally
---

The Agent App is our go-to workspace for building agentic systems. It contains:

- A FastAPI server for serving Agents, Teams and Workflows.
- A streamlit application for debugging and testing. This streamlit app is very versatile and can be used as an admin interface for the agentic system and shows all sorts of data.
- A postgres database for session and vector storage.


It's designed to run locally using docker and in production on AWS.
