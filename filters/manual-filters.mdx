# Manual Knowledge Filters

Manual filtering gives you full control over which documents are searched by specifying filters directly in your code.

## Step 1: Attach Metadata

There are two ways to attach metadata to your documents:

1. **Attach Metadata When Initializing the Knowledge Base**

    ```python
    knowledge_base = PDFKnowledgeBase(
        path=[
            {
                "path": "path/to/cv1.pdf",
                "metadata": {
                    "user_id": "jordan_mitchell",
                    "document_type": "cv",
                    "year": 2025,
                },
            },
            # ... more documents ...
        ],
        vector_db=vector_db,
    )
    knowledge_base.load(recreate=True)
    ```

2. **Attach Metadata When Loading Documents One by One**

    ```python
    # Initialize the PDFKnowledgeBase
    knowledge_base = PDFKnowledgeBase(
        vector_db=vector_db,
        num_documents=5,
    )

    # Load first document with user_1 metadata
    knowledge_base.load_document(
        path=path/to/cv1.pdf,
        metadata={"user_id": "jordan_mitchell", "document_type": "cv", "year": 2025},
        recreate=True,  # Set to True only for the first run, then set to False
    )

    # Load second document with user_2 metadata
    knowledge_base.load_document(
        path=path/to/cv2.pdf,
        metadata={"user_id": "taylor_brooks", "document_type": "cv", "year": 2025},
    )
    ```

> 💡 **Tips:**  
> • Use **Option 1** if you have all your documents and metadata ready at once.  
> • Use **Option 2** if you want to add documents incrementally or as they become available.

## Step 2: Query with Filters

You can pass filters in two ways:

### 1. On the Agent (applies to all queries)

```python
agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    search_knowledge=True,
    knowledge_filters={"user_id": "jordan_mitchell"},
)
agent.print_response(
    "Tell me about Jordan Mitchell's experience and skills",
    markdown=True,
)
```

### 2. On Each Query (overrides Agent filters for that run)

```python
agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    search_knowledge=True,
)
agent.print_response(
    "Tell me about Jordan Mitchell's experience and skills",
    knowledge_filters={"user_id": "jordan_mitchell"},
    markdown=True,
)
```

<Note>If you pass filters both on the Agent and on the query, the query-level filters take precedence.</Note>

## Combining Multiple Filters

You can filter by multiple fields:

```python
agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    search_knowledge=True,
    knowledge_filters={
        "user_id": "jordan_mitchell",
        "document_type": "cv",
        "year": 2025,
    }
)
agent.print_response(
    "Tell me about Jordan Mitchell's experience and skills",
    markdown=True,
)
```

## Try It Yourself!

- Load documents with different metadata.
- Query with different filter combinations.
- Observe how the results change!
