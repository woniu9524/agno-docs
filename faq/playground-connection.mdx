If you're experiencing connection issues in the Agno Playground, particularly when trying to connect to **local endpoints**, this guide will help you resolve them.

## Browser Compatibility

Some browsers have security restrictions that prevent connections to localhost domains due to mixed content security issues. Here's what you need to know about different browsers:

### Recommended Browsers
- **Chrome & Edge**: These browsers work well with local connections by default and are our recommended choices
- **Firefox**: Generally works well with local connections

### Browsers with Known Issues
- **Safari**: May block local connections due to its strict security policies
- **Brave**: Blocks local connections by default due to its shield feature

## Solutions

### For Brave Users
If you're using Brave browser, you can try these steps:
1. Click on the Brave shield icon in the address bar
2. Turn off the shield for the current site
3. Refresh the endpoint and try connecting again

### For Other Browsers
If you're using Safari or experiencing issues with other browsers, you can use one of these solutions:

#### 1. Use Chrome or Edge
The simplest solution is to use Chrome or Edge browsers which have better support for local connections.

#### 2. Use Tunneling Services
You can use tunneling services to expose your local endpoint to the internet:

##### Using ngrok
1. Install ngrok from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)
2. Run your local server
3. Create a tunnel with ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http <your-local-port>
```
4. Use the provided ngrok URL in the playground

##### Using Cloudflare Tunnel
1. Install Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) from [Cloudflare's website](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/)
2. Authenticate with Cloudflare
3. Create a tunnel:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<your-local-port>
```
4. Use the provided Cloudflare URL in the playground
