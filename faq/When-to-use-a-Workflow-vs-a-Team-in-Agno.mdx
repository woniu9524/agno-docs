Agno offers two powerful ways to build multi-agent systems: **Workflows** and **Teams**. Each is suited for different kinds of use-cases.

---

## Use a Workflow when:

You want to execute a fixed series of steps with a predictable outcome.

Workflows are ideal for:

- Step-by-step agent executions
- Data extraction or transformation
- Tasks that don’t need reasoning or decision-making

## Use an Agent Team when:

Your task requires reasoning, collaboration, or multi-tool decision-making.

Agent Teams are best for:

- Research and planning
- Tasks where agents divide responsibilities

## 💡 Pro Tip

> Think of **Workflows** as assembly lines for known tasks,
> and **Agent Teams** as collaborative task forces for solving open-ended problems.
