title: Reasoning Tools
---

A new class of research is emerging where giving models tools for structured thinking, like a scratchpad, greatly improves their reasoning capabilities.

For example, by giving a model a **"think" tool**, we can greatly improve its reasoning capabilities by providing a dedicated space for working through the problem. This is a simple, yet effective approach to add reasoning to non-reasoning models.

First published by Anthropic in [this blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool), this technique has been practiced by many AI Engineers (including our own team) long before it was published.

## v0: The Think Tool

The first version of the Think Tool was published by Anthropic in [this blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool).

```python claude_thinking_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.thinking import ThinkingTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"),
    tools=[
        ThinkingTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(
            stock_price=True,
            analyst_recommendations=True,
            company_info=True,
            company_news=True,
        ),
    ],
    instructions="Use tables where possible",
    markdown=True,
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reasoning_agent.print_response(
        "Write a report on NVDA. Only the report, no other text.",
        stream=True,
        show_full_reasoning=True,
        stream_intermediate_steps=True,
    )
```

## v1: The Reasoning Tools

While the v0 Think Tool is a great start, it is limited in that it only allows for a thinking space. The v1 Reasoning Tools take this one step further by allowing the Agent to **analyze** the results of their actions (i.e. tool calls), greatly improving the Agents' ability to solve problems that require sequential tool calls.

**ReasoningTools = `think` + `analyze`**

```python claude_reasoning_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    show_tool_calls=True,
)
reasoning_agent.print_response(
    "Write a report comparing NVDA to TSLA", stream=True, markdown=True
)
```
