## 1.2.5

## New Features:

- **E2B Tools:** Added E2B Tools to run code in E2B Sandbox

## Improvements:

- **Teams Tools**: Add `tools` and `tool_call_limit` to `Team`. This means the team leader itself can also have tools provided by the user, so it can act as an agent.
- **Teams Instructions:** Improved instructions around attached images, audio, videos, and files. This should increase success when attaching artifacts to prompts meant for member agents.
- **MCP Include/Exclude Tools**: Expanded `MCPTools` to allow you to specify tools to specifically include or exclude from all the available tools on an MCP server. This is very useful for limiting which tools the model has access to.
- **Tool Decorator Async Support**: The `@tool()` decorator now supports async functions, including async pre and post-hooks.

## Bug Fixes:

<Update label="2025-03-20" description="v1.1.14">
## 1.1.14 - Teams Revamp

## New Features:

- **Teams Revamp**: Announcing a new iteration of Agent teams with the following features:
    - Create a `Team` in one of 3 modes: “Collaborate”, “Coordinate” or “Route”.
    - Various improvements have been made that was broken with the previous teams implementation. Including returning structured output from member agents (for “route” mode), passing images, audio and video to member agents, etc.
    - It has added features like “agentic shared context” between team members and sharing of individual team member responses with other team members.
    - This also comes with a revamp of Agent and Team debug logs. Use `debug_mode=True` and `team.print_response(...)` to see it in action.
    - Find the docs [here](https://docs.agno.com/teams/introduction). Please look at the example implementations [here](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/blob/c8e47d1643065a0a6ee795c6b063f8576a7a2ef6/cookbook/examples/teams).
    - This is the first release. Please give us feedback. Updates and improvements will follow.
    - Support for `Agent(team=[])` is still there, but deprecated (see below).
- **LiteLLM:** Added [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) support, both as a native implementation and via the `OpenAILike` interface.

## Improvements:

- **Change structured_output to response_format:** Added `use_json_mode: bool = False` as a parameter of `Agent` and `Team`, which in conjunction with `response_model=YourModel`, is used to indicate whether the agent/team model should be forced to respond in json instead of (now default) structured output. Previous behaviour defaulted to “json-mode”, but since most models now support native structured output, we are now defaulting to native structured output.  It is now also much simpler to work with response models, since now only `response_model` needs to be set. It is not necessary anymore to set `structured_output=True` to specifically get structured output from the model.
- **Website Tools + Combined Knowledgebase:** Added functionality for `WebsiteTools` to also update combined knowledgebases.

## Bug Fixes:

- **AgentMemory**: Fixed `get_message_pairs()` fetching incorrect messages.
- **UnionType in Functions**: Fixed issue with function parsing where pipe-style unions were used in function parameters.
- **Gemini Array Function Parsing**: Fixed issue preventing gemini function parsing to work in some MCP cases.

## Deprecations:

- **Structured Output:** `Agent.structured_output` has been replaced by `Agent.use_json_mode`. This will be removed in a future major version release.
- **Agent Team:** `Agent.team` is deprecated with the release of our new Teams implementation [here](https://docs.agno.com/teams/introduction). This will be removed in a future major version release.

</Update>
<Update label="2025-03-14" description="v1.1.13">
## 1.1.13

## Improvements:

- **OpenAIResponses File Search**: Added support for the built-in [“File Search”](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search) function from OpenAI. This automatically uploads `File` objects attached to the agent prompt.
- **OpenAIReponses web citations**: Added support to extract URL citations after usage of the built-in “Web Search” tool from OpenAI.
- **Anthropic document citations**: Added support to extract document citations from Claude responses when `File` objects are attached to agent prompts.

## Bug Fixes:

- **Ollama tools**: Fixed issues with tools where parameters are not typed.
- **Anthropic Structured Output**: Fixed issue affecting Anthropic and Anthropic via Azure where structured output wouldn’t work in some cases. This should make the experience of using structured output for models that don’t natively support it better overall. Also now works with enums as types in the Pydantic model.
- **Google Maps Places**: Support from Google for Places API has been changed and this brings it up to date so we can continue to support “search places”.

    - This only works with `OpenAIChat` with the `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model. See [their docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio) for more on how it works. For example
        
        ```python
        from agno.agent import Agent
        from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
        from agno.utils.audio import write_audio_to_file
        
        agent = Agent(
            model=OpenAIChat(
                id="gpt-4o-audio-preview",
                modalities=["text", "audio"],  # Both text and audio responses are provided.
                audio={"voice": "alloy", "format": "wav"},
            ),
        )
        agent.print_response(
            "Tell me a 5 second story"
        )
        if agent.run_response.response_audio is not None:
            write_audio_to_file(
                audio=agent.run_response.response_audio.base64_audio, filename=str(filename)
            )
        ```

The `url` and `fetch_url` parameters have been removed, and API URLs are now decided based on the `file_type` provided by the user.
    
    ```python
    MODELS_LAB_URLS = {
        "MP4": "https://modelslab.com/api/v6/video/text2video",
        "MP3": "https://modelslab.com/api/v6/voice/music_gen",
        "GIF": "https://modelslab.com/api/v6/video/text2video",
    }
    
    MODELS_LAB_FETCH_URLS = {
        "MP4": "https://modelslab.com/api/v6/video/fetch",
        "MP3": "https://modelslab.com/api/v6/voice/fetch",
        "GIF": "https://modelslab.com/api/v6/video/fetch",
    }
    ```
    
    The `FileType` enum now includes `MP3` type:
    
    ```jsx
    class FileType(str, Enum):
        MP4 = "mp4"
        GIF = "gif"
        MP3 = "mp3"

## 1.0.0 - Agno

This is the major refactor from `phidata` to `agno`, released with the official launch of Agno AI.

See the [migration guide](../how-to/phidata-to-agno) for additional guidance.

## Interface Changes:

- `phi.model.x` → `agno.models.x`
- `phi.knowledge_base.x` → `agno.knowledge.x` (applies to all knowledge bases)
- `phi.document.reader.xxx` → `agno.document.reader.xxx_reader` (applies to all document readers)
- All Agno toolkits are now suffixed with `Tools`. E.g. `DuckDuckGo` → `DuckDuckGoTools`
- Multi-modal interface updates:

  - `agent.run(images=[])` and `agent.print_response(images=[])` is now of type `Image`

    ```python
    class Image(BaseModel):
        url: Optional[str] = None  # Remote location for image
        filepath: Optional[Union[Path, str]] = None  # Absolute local location for image
        content: Optional[Any] = None  # Actual image bytes content
        detail: Optional[str] = None # low, medium, high or auto (per OpenAI spec https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision?lang=node#low-or-high-fidelity-image-understanding)
        id: Optional[str] = None
    ```

  - `agent.run(audio=[])` and `agent.print_response(audio=[])` is now of type `Audio`

    ```python
    class Audio(BaseModel):
        filepath: Optional[Union[Path, str]] = None  # Absolute local location for audio
        content: Optional[Any] = None  # Actual audio bytes content
        format: Optional[str] = None
    ```

  - `agent.run(video=[])` and `agent.print_response(video=[])` is now of type `Video`

    ```python
    class Video(BaseModel):
        filepath: Optional[Union[Path, str]] = None  # Absolute local location for video
        content: Optional[Any] = None  # Actual video bytes content
    ```

  - `RunResponse.images` is now a list of type `ImageArtifact`

    ```python
    class ImageArtifact(Media):
        id: str
        url: str  # Remote location for file
        alt_text: Optional[str] = None
    ```

  - `RunResponse.audio` is now a list of type `AudioArtifact`

    ```python
    class AudioArtifact(Media):
        id: str
        url: Optional[str] = None  # Remote location for file
        base64_audio: Optional[str] = None  # Base64-encoded audio data
        length: Optional[str] = None
        mime_type: Optional[str] = None
    ```

  - `RunResponse.videos` is now a list of type `VideoArtifact`

    ```python
    class VideoArtifact(Media):
        id: str
        url: str  # Remote location for file
        eta: Optional[str] = None
        length: Optional[str] = None
    ```

  - `RunResponse.response_audio` is now of type `AudioOutput`

    ```python
    class AudioOutput(BaseModel):
        id: str
        content: str  # Base64 encoded
        expires_at: int
        transcript: str
    ```

- Models:
  - `Hermes` → `OllamaHermes`
  - `AzureOpenAIChat` → `AzureOpenAI`
  - `CohereChat` → `Cohere`
  - `DeepSeekChat` → `DeepSeek`
  - `GeminiOpenAIChat` → `GeminiOpenAI`
  - `HuggingFaceChat` → `HuggingFace`
- Embedders now all take `id` instead of `model` as a parameter. For example

  ```python
  db_url = "postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"

  knowledge_base = PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(
      urls=["https://agno-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf"],
      vector_db=PgVector(
          table_name="recipes",
          db_url=db_url,
          embedder=OllamaEmbedder(id="llama3.2", dimensions=3072),
      ),
  )
  knowledge_base.load(recreate=True)
  ```

- Agent Storage class
  - `PgAgentStorage` → `PostgresDbAgentStorage`
  - `SqlAgentStorage` → `SqliteDbAgentStorage`
  - `MongoAgentStorage` → `MongoDbAgentStorage`
  - `S2AgentStorage` → `SingleStoreDbAgentStorage`
- Workflow Storage class
  - `SqlWorkflowStorage` → `SqliteDbWorkflowStorage`
  - `PgWorkflowStorage` → `PostgresDbWorkflowStorage`
  - `MongoWorkflowStorage` → `MongoDbWorkflowStorage`
- Knowledge Base
  - `phi.knowledge.pdf.PDFUrlKnowledgeBase` → `agno.knowledge.pdf_url.PDFUrlKnowledgeBase`
  - `phi.knowledge.csv.CSVUrlKnowledgeBase` → `agno.knowledge.csv_url.CSVUrlKnowledgeBase`
- Readers
  - `phi.document.reader.arxiv` → `agno.document.reader.arxiv_reader`
  - `phi.document.reader.docx` → `agno.document.reader.docx_reader`
  - `phi.document.reader.json` → `agno.document.reader.json_reader`
  - `phi.document.reader.pdf` → `agno.document.reader.pdf_reader`
  - `phi.document.reader.s3.pdf` → `agno.document.reader.s3.pdf_reader`
  - `phi.document.reader.s3.text` → `agno.document.reader.s3.text_reader`
  - `phi.document.reader.text` → `agno.document.reader.text_reader`
  - `phi.document.reader.website` → `agno.document.reader.website_reader`

## Improvements:

- **Dataclasses:** Changed various instances of Pydantic models to dataclasses to improve the speed.
- Moved `Embedder` class from pydantic to data class

## Removals

- Removed all references to `Assistant`
- Removed all references to `llm`
- Removed the `PhiTools` tool
- On the `Agent` class, `guidelines`, `prevent_hallucinations`, `prevent_prompt_leakage`, `limit_tool_access`, and `task` has been removed. They can be incorporated into the `instructions` parameter as you see fit.

## Bug Fixes:

- **Semantic Chunking:** Fixed semantic chunking by replacing `similarity_threshold` param with `threshold` param.

## New Features:

- **Evals for Agents:** Introducing Evals to measure the performance, accuracy, and reliability of your Agents.
