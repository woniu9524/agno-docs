1. **Session Storage (chat history and session state):** Session storage saves an Agent's sessions in a database and enables Agents to have multi-turn conversations. Session storage also holds the session state, which is persisted across runs because it is saved to the database after each run. Session storage is a form of short-term memory **called "Storage" in Agno**.

2. **User Memories (user preferences):** The Agent can store insights and facts about the user that it learns through conversation. This helps the agents personalize its response to the user it is interacting with. Think of this as adding "ChatGPT like memory" to your agent. **This is called "Memory" in Agno**.

3. **Session Summaries (chat summary):** The Agent can store a condensed representations of the session, useful when chat histories gets too long. **This is called "Summary" in Agno**.
