title: Sessions
---

When we call `Agent.run()`, it creates a stateless, singular Agent run.

But what if we want to continue this run i.e. have a multi-turn conversation? That's where `sessions` come in. A session is collection of consecutive runs.

In practice, a session is a multi-turn conversation between a user and an Agent. Using a `session_id`, we can pass the conversation history and state across multiple runs.

Let's outline some key concepts:

- **Session:** A session is collection of consecutive runs like a multi-turn conversation between a user and an Agent. Sessions are identified by a `session_id` and each turn is a **run**.
- **Run:** Every interaction (i.e. chat or turn) with an Agent is called a **run**. Runs are identified by a `run_id` and `Agent.run()` creates a new `run_id` when called.
- **Messages:** are the individual messages sent between the model and the Agent. Messages are the communication protocol between the Agent and model.

Let's start with an example where a single run is created with an Agent. A `run_id` is automatically generated, as well as a `session_id` (because we didn't provide one to continue the conversation). This run is not yet associated with a user.

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a variable
agent.print_response("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")
```

## Multi-user, multi-session Agents

Each user that is interacting with an Agent gets a unique set of sessions and you can have multiple users interacting with the same Agent at the same time.

Set a `user_id` to connect a user to their sessions with the Agent.

In the example below, we set a `session_id` to demo how to have multi-turn conversations with multiple users at the same time. In production, the `session_id` is auto generated.

<Note>

Note: Multi-user, multi-session currently only works with `Memory.v2`, which will become the default memory implementation in the next release.

</Note>

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.memory.v2 import Memory

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    # Multi-user, multi-session only work with Memory.v2
    memory=Memory(),
    add_history_to_messages=True,
    num_history_runs=3,
)

user_1_id = "user_101"
user_2_id = "user_102"

user_1_session_id = "session_101"
user_2_session_id = "session_102"

# Start the session with user 1
agent.print_response(
    "Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot.",
    user_id=user_1_id,
    session_id=user_1_session_id,
)
# Continue the session with user 1
agent.print_response("Now tell me a joke.", user_id=user_1_id, session_id=user_1_session_id)

# Start the session with user 2
agent.print_response("Tell me about quantum physics.", user_id=user_2_id, session_id=user_2_session_id)
# Continue the session with user 2
agent.print_response("What is the speed of light?", user_id=user_2_id, session_id=user_2_session_id)

# Ask the agent to give a summary of the conversation, this will use the history from the previous messages
agent.print_response(
    "Give me a summary of our conversation.",
    user_id=user_1_id,
    session_id=user_1_session_id,
)
```
