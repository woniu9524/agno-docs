## What are Agents?

**Agents** are intelligent programs that solve problems autonomously.

Agents have memory, domain knowledge and the ability to use tools (like searching the web, querying a database, making API calls). Unlike traditional programs that follow a predefined execution path, Agents dynamically adapt their approach based on the context and tool results.

Instead of a rigid binary definition, let's think of Agents in terms of agency and autonomy.

- **Level 0**: Agents with no tools (basic inference tasks).
- **Level 1**: Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.
- **Level 2**: Agents with knowledge, combining memory and reasoning.
- **Level 3**: Teams of specialized agents collaborating on complex workflows.

If this is your first time building agents, [follow this guide](/agents) and then dive into more advanced concepts.

## Example: Research Agent

Let's create a research agent that can search the web using DuckDuckGo, scrape the top links using Newspaper4k and write a research report for us. Ideally we'll use specialized tools (like Exa) but let's start with the free tools first.
