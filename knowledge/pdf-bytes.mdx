The **PDFBytesKnowledgeBase** reads **PDF content from bytes or IO streams**, converts them into vector embeddings and loads them to a vector database. This is useful when working with dynamically generated PDFs, API responses, or file uploads without needing to save files to disk.

## Usage

<Note>

We are using a local LanceDB database for this example. [Make sure it's running](https://docs.agno.com/vectordb/lancedb)

</Note>

```shell
pip install pypdf
```

```python knowledge_base.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.knowledge.pdf import PDFBytesKnowledgeBase
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb

vector_db = LanceDb(
    table_name="recipes_async",
    uri="tmp/lancedb",
)

with open("data/pdfs/ThaiRecipes.pdf", "rb") as f:
    pdf_bytes = f.read()

knowledge_base = PDFBytesKnowledgeBase(
    pdfs=[pdf_bytes],
    vector_db=vector_db,
)
knowledge_base.load(recreate=False)  # Comment out after first run

agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    search_knowledge=True,
)

agent.print_response("How to make Tom Kha Gai?", markdown=True)
```

## Params

| Parameter | Type           | Default | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | -------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pdfs | Union[List[bytes], List[IO]] | - | List of PDF content as bytes or IO streams. |
| exclude_files | List[str] | [] | List of file patterns to exclude (inherited from base class). |
| reader | Union[PDFReader, PDFImageReader] | PDFReader() | A PDFReader or PDFImageReader that converts the PDFs into Documents for the vector database. |

`PDFBytesKnowledgeBase` is a subclass of the [AgentKnowledge](/reference/knowledge/base) class and has access to the same params.
