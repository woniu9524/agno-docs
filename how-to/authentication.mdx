There are two ways to authenticate with Agno:

1. Using the CLI setup command (`ag setup`)
2. Setting the API key manually in your environment

### Method 1: CLI Authentication

The fastest way to authenticate is using the Agno CLI:

```bash
ag setup
```

This command will open your browser to authenticate with Agno Platform & automatically configure your workspace 


### Method 2: Manual API Key Setup

Alternatively, you can manually set up your API key:

1. Get your API key from [app.agno.com/settings](https://app.agno.com/settings)
2. Set the API key in your environment

<CodeGroup>
```bash Mac
export AGNO_API_KEY=ag-***
```

```bash Windows
setx AGNO_API_KEY ag-***
```
</CodeGroup>
