title: Collaborate
---

In **Collaborate Mode**, all team members respond to the user query at once. This gives the team coordinator to review whether the team has reached a consensus on a particular topic and then synthesize the responses from all team members into a single response.

This is especially useful when used with `async await`, because it allows the individual members to respond concurrently and the coordinator to synthesize the responses asynchronously.

## How Collaborate Mode Works

In "collaborate" mode:

1. The team receives a user query
2. All team members get sent a query. When running synchronously, this happens one by one. When running asynchronously, this happens concurrently.
3. Each team member produces an output
4. The coordinator reviews the outputs and synthesizes them into a single response

    Run the team

    ```shell

## Defining Success Criteria

You can guide the collaborative team by specifying success criteria for the team coordinator to evaluate:

```python
strategy_team = Team(
    members=[hackernews_researcher, academic_paper_researcher, twitter_researcher],
    mode="collaborate",
    name="Research Team",
    description="A team that researches a topic",
    success_criteria="The team has reached a consensus on the topic",
)

response = strategy_team.run(
    "What is the best way to learn to code?"
)
```
