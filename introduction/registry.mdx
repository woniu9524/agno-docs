## Register Your Components

In Agno you create Agents, Teams, Workflows, and Apps. These are collectively referred to as "Components of your Agentic System".
When you run any of the above components, it is automatically registered and monitored out of the box. This means you can instantly view them, along with their metadata and configuration, in the Agno Registry.

The Registry acts as a unified dashboard where all your Agno Agents, Teams, Workflows and Apps are displayed, giving you full visibility into your operational environment. No additional setup is required.

Start exploring at [app.agno.com/registry](https://app.agno.com/registry).

## Authenticate & Enable Monitoring

<Steps>
<Step title= "Authenticate using CLI or API key">
To log agent sessions, you need to authenticate using one of these methods:

**Method A: Log in using your command line interface**
```bash
ag setup
```

**Method B: Log using an API key**

Get your API key from [Agno App](https://app.agno.com/settings) and use it to connect your agents to the Agno Platform.

```bash
export AGNO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Monitoring">

After authentication, enable monitoring for a particular agent or globally for all agents.

**Method A: For a Specific Agent**
```python
agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
```

**Method B: Globally via Environment Variable**
```bash
export AGNO_MONITOR=true
```
</Step>

<Step title="Register Your Component">

Once monitoring is enabled, you can run your agent/team/workflow/app and view it in the registry:

1. Create a file `agent.py` with this sample code:



```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.knowledge.url import UrlKnowledge
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.memory.v2.db.sqlite import SqliteMemoryDb
from agno.memory.v2.memory import Memory
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType
from agno.storage.sqlite import SqliteStorage

memory = Memory(
    db=SqliteMemoryDb(table_name="memory", db_file="tmp/memory.db"),
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
)
# Load Agno documentation in a knowledge base
knowledge = UrlKnowledge(
    urls=["https://docs.agno.com/introduction/agents.md"],
    vector_db=LanceDb(
        uri="tmp/lancedb",
        table_name="agno_docs",
        search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
        # Use OpenAI for embeddings
        embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small", dimensions=1536),
    ),
)

agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Assist",
    description="You can answer questions from the agno documentation",
    agent_id="agno-assist",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    storage=SqliteStorage(table_name="agent_sessions", db_file="tmp/agents.db"),
    memory=memory,
    enable_agentic_memory=True,
    instructions=[
        "Use tables to display data.",
        "Include sources in your response.",
        "Search your knowledge before answering the question.",
        "Only include the output in your response. No other text.",
    ],
    knowledge=knowledge,
    tools=[ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True)],
    add_datetime_to_instructions=True,
    markdown=True,
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load the knowledge base, comment out after first run
    # Set recreate to True to recreate the knowledge base if needed
    agent.knowledge.load(recreate=False)
    agent.print_response(
        "What are Agents?",
        stream=True,
        show_full_reasoning=True,
        stream_intermediate_steps=True,
    )
```


2. Run your code locally
3. View your agent at [app.agno.com/registry](https://app.agno.com/registry)

4. You can also check your agent configuration

<img height="200" src="/images/registry-agent-config.png" style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }} />
</Step>
</Steps>

### Applications
You can register any application simply by running it — it will be monitored and visible on the platform automatically where you can view and interact with each component's configuration in detail.

<Note>
Additionally Playground apps can be opened and explored in the Agno Playground.
