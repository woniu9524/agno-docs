## Session Monitoring

You can track your agent sessions and performance in real-time on [app.agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

## Authenticate & Enable Monitoring

<Steps>
<Step title="Authenticate using CLI or API key">

To log agent sessions locally, you need to authenticate using one of these methods:

**Method A: Log in using your command line interface**

This will store your authentication token locally.

```bash
ag setup
```

**Method B: Log using an API key**

Get your API key from [Agno App](https://app.agno.com/settings) and use it to log agent sessions to your workspace.

```bash
export AGNO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Monitoring">

After authentication, enable monitoring for a particular agent or globally for all agents.

**Method A: For a Specific Agent**
```python
agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
```

**Method B: Globally via Environment Variable**
```bash
export AGNO_MONITOR=true
```
</Step>

<Step title="Track Your Agent Sessions">

Once monitoring is enabled, you can run your agent and view its session data.

1. Create a file `monitoring.py` with this sample code:
   ```python monitoring.py
   from agno.agent import Agent

   agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
   agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
   ```

2. Run your Agent

3. View your sessions at [app.agno.com/sessions](https://app.agno.com/sessions)

## Agent Registry

Agents, Teams and Workflows are collectively referred to as "Components of your Agentic System". When you run them with monitoring enabled, they are registered with the Agno Platform. This means you can view their metadata, runs and configuration.

The Registry acts as a unified dashboard where all your Agno Agents, Teams, Workflows and Apps are displayed, giving you full visibility into your operational environment.

Start exploring your Agents, Teams and Workflows at [app.agno.com/registry](https://app.agno.com/registry).
