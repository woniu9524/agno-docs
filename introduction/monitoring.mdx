## Monitor Your Agents

You can track your agents sessions and performance to ensure everything is working as expected. Agno provides built-in monitoring that you can access at [app.agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

## Authenticate & Enable Monitoring

### Step 1: Authenticate using CLI or API key

To log agent sessions, you need to authenticate using one of these methods:

**Method A: Log in using your command line interface**
```bash
ag setup
```

**Method B: Log using an API key**

Get your API key from [Agno App](https://app.agno.com/settings) and use it to log agent sessions to your workspace.

```bash
export AGNO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 2: Enable Monitoring

After authentication, enable monitoring for a particular agent or globally for all agents.

**Method A: For a Specific Agent**
```python
agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
```

**Method B: Globally via Environment Variable**
```bash
export AGNO_MONITOR=true
```

### Step 3: Track Your Agent Sessions

Once monitoring is enabled, you can run your agent and view its session data:

1. Create a file `monitoring.py` with this sample code:
   ```python
   from agno.agent import Agent

   agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
   agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
   ```

2. Run your code locally
3. View your sessions at [app.agno.com/sessions](https://app.agno.com/sessions)
