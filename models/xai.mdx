xAI is a platform for providing endpoints for Large Language models.
See their list of models [here](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models).

We recommend experimenting to find the best-suited model for your use-case. `grok-beta` model is good for most use-cases.

xAI has rate limits on their APIs. See the [docs](https://docs.x.ai/docs/usage-tiers-and-rate-limits) for more information.

## Authentication

Set your `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one [from xAI here](https://console.x.ai/).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export XAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

```bash Windows
setx XAI_API_KEY sk-***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `xAI` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py

from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.xai import xAI

agent = Agent(
    model=xAI(id="grok-beta"),
    markdown=True
)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")

```

</CodeGroup>
