Run Large Language Models locally with LM Studio

[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) is a fantastic tool for running models locally.

LM Studio supports multiple open-source models. See the library [here](https://lmstudio.ai/models).

We recommend experimenting to find the best-suited model for your use-case. Here are some general recommendations:

- `llama3.3` models are good for most basic use-cases.
- `qwen` models perform specifically well with tool use.
- `deepseek-r1` models have strong reasoning capabilities.
- `phi4` models are powerful, while being really small in size.

## Set up a model

Install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), download the model you want to use, and run it.

## Example

After you have the model locally, use the `LM Studio` model class to access it

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.lmstudio import LMStudio

agent = Agent(
    model=LMStudio(id="qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m"),
    markdown=True
)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
```

</CodeGroup>
