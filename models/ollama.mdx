Run Large Language Models locally with Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.com) is a fantastic tool for running models locally.

Ollama supports multiple open-source models. See the library [here](https://ollama.com/library).

We recommend experimenting to find the best-suited model for your use-case. Here are some general recommendations:

- `llama3.3` models are good for most basic use-cases.
- `qwen` models perform specifically well with tool use.
- `deepseek-r1` models have strong reasoning capabilities.
- `phi4` models are powerful, but really small in size.


## Set up a model
Install [ollama](https://ollama.com) and run a model using

```bash run model
ollama run llama3.1
```
This gives you an interactive session with the model.

Alternatively, to download the model to be used in an Agno agent

```bash pull model
ollama pull llama3.1
```

## Example

After you have the model locally, use the `Ollama` model class to access it

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.ollama import Ollama

agent = Agent(
    model=Ollama(id="llama3.1"),
    markdown=True
)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Params

<Snippet file="model-ollama-params.mdx" />

`Ollama` is a subclass of the [Model](/reference/model) class and has access to the same params.
