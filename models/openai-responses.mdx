title: OpenAI Responses
---

`OpenAIResponses` is a class for interacting with OpenAI models using the Responses API. This class provides a streamlined interface for working with OpenAI's newer Responses API, which is distinct from the traditional Chat API. It supports advanced features like tool use, file processing, and knowledge retrieval.


## Authentication

Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one [from OpenAI here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

```bash Windows
setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `OpenAIResponses` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.media import File
from agno.models.openai.responses import OpenAIResponses

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIResponses(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[{"type": "file_search"}, {"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    markdown=True,
)

agent.print_response(
    "Summarize the contents of the attached file and search the web for more information.",
    files=[File(url="https://agno-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf")],
)

```

</CodeGroup>
