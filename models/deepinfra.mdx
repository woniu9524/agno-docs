Leverage DeepInfra's powerful command models and more.

[DeepInfra](https://deepinfra.com) supports a wide range of models. See their library of models [here](https://deepinfra.com/models).

We recommend experimenting to find the best-suited model for your use-case. Here are some general recommendations:

- `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B` model is good for reasoning.
- `meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf` model is good for basic use-cases.
- `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` model is good for multi-step tasks.

DeepInfra has rate limits. See the [docs](https://deepinfra.com/docs/advanced/rate-limits) for more information.

## Authentication

Set your `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY` environment variable. Get your key from [here](https://deepinfra.com/dash/api_keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export DEEPINFRA_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx DEEPINFRA_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `DeepInfra` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.deepinfra import DeepInfra

agent = Agent(
    model=DeepInfra(id="meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf"),
    markdown=True
)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")

```

</CodeGroup>

`DeepInfra` is a subclass of the [Model](/reference/models/model) class and has access to the same params.
