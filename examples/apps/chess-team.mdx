### System Components
- White Piece Agent: Strategizes and selects moves for white pieces
- Black Piece Agent: Controls and determines moves for black pieces
- Legal Move Agent: Validates all proposed moves against chess rules
- Master Agent: Coordinates the game flow and monitors game status

### Advanced Features
The system demonstrates complex agent interactions where each AI component has a specific role. The agents communicate and coordinate to create a complete chess-playing experience, showcasing how multiple specialized AIs can work together effectively.

### Code
The complete code is available in the [Agno repository](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/examples/apps/chess_team).

### Usage
<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
