### System Components
- X Piece Agent: Strategizes and selects moves for X pieces
- O Piece Agent: Controls and determines moves for O pieces
- Board Agent: Validates all proposed moves against game rules
- Master Agent: Coordinates the game flow and monitors game status

### Advanced Features
The system demonstrates complex agent interactions where each AI component has a specific role. The agents communicate and coordinate to create a complete tic-tac-toe experience, showcasing how multiple specialized AIs can work together effectively.

### Code
The complete code is available in the [Agno repository](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/examples/apps/tic_tac_toe).
