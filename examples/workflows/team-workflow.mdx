title: Team Workflow
---
**TeamWorkflow** 会生成关于热门 Reddit 和 Hacker News帖子的摘要报告。
本示例演示了工作流节点中团队的用法。

创建一个名为 `team_worklfow.py` 的文件，其中包含以下代码：

```python team_worklfow.py

from textwrap import dedent

from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
from agno.tools.newspaper4k import Newspaper4kTools
from agno.utils.log import logger
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response
from agno.workflow import Workflow
